A shareable semantic-release config for projects that are on github and do not
need any special build or release steps.

- creates a tag and github release
- updates the ```CHANGELOG.md```

The commit parsing is based on the conventionalcommits preset but adds a bunch
of commit types and changes a few of the commit-type â†’ release-type mappings.

The styling of release-notes and changelog was changes to more closely resemble
the angular preset.
